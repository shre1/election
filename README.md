Code Fun Do++
Electoral contestants and election observers have a critical role to play in ensuring the   transparency of an election process. It is not possible for everyone to understand e-voting and counting systems. Thus, voters rely on others who have the capacity to understand these processes. 
With traditional paper-based voting and manual counting, observers focus on the voting and counting process itself. Electronic voting and counting technologies entail several other activities, some critical to the integrity of the process, that can be observed, but which take place well in advance of Election Day.

Keeping the above said description, I would like to mention the steps that can be taken to make the election process safe and secure. They are as follows:-

Parallel working
Microcontrollers can be largely used for this purpose and can prevent the mishaps going in election for the future  election.
Though in microcontrollers, there are various varieties, but the considering the situation, best option will be Arduino.
It’s handy controller with various supporting features that can be availed by a user.
I found certain devices which can be used via Arduino , which can be easily used with proper coding.

So, features of it which can be very efficiently used are as follows:
	Fingerprint sensor/scanner:
A fingerprint scanner is a type of technology that identifies and authenticates the fingerprints of an individual in order to grant or deny access to a computer system or a physical facility.
It is a type of biometric security technology that utilizes the combination of hardware and software techniques to identify the fingerprint scans of an individual.

So, knowing the function, what I thought is, whenever a voter is giving his/her vote then he/she must put fingerprint on the sensor so that Arduino ensures authenticity of the voter and keep a record of the no. of voters who have casted their voters. 
So, whenever a check is required at the total, then Arduino record can easily secure us.

	GIS sensor
This sensor is also very important that can be highly used. 
The location where the person is casting his vote can be viewed easily and can help us to easily locate any area very easily by linking GIS sensor with location of the voting machine.
	RFID card
These cards can be used just for the security purpose to allow the candidate to enter the poll area.
	Visual cameras
Visual /virtual footage of the process during the election can act as a great security option as it can simply capture all the things and if something is reported wrong, then it can help in validating / verifying the details and get the issues sorted out.

	Webpage
Webpage can be designed with can include multiple features with proper security.
The webpage can let the viewers showcase about the procedure of election. Also, the nominee who are standing for the election can be showcased and video of their promotion  can be shown. An option can also be put upon to link the Aadhar card and voter id, and this step will also emphasis the citizens to get their Aadhar card issued.
	Online tracking system
A system can be made so that at polls, so that process of election can smoothly undergo.
	Link of Aadhar card, PAN card, or voter card
This step can significantly help and ease the voters.
	Use of Ethernet cable
This will enable the polls to use only specific internet and special services can be implemented so that any malpractices can be abandoned right away.

	Undergo a tech face-lift.
We can upgrade technology at government offices to help citizens register to vote. When voters interact with those offices/ departments, those offices should transfer registration information electronically to election officials.

	NOTA Option to voters:
Voters must be given NOTA (None Of The Above) as last option while casting their votes. This will show the voters confidence in the participating candidates.

	Early voting options to voters:
Many of the voters remains out of the election process as they are working far away from their voting zones and hence find it difficult to cats vote. Though postal ballot option is there but it is bit cumbersome. Hence by permitting voters early ma
New York is one of only 18 states nationwide that does not give every eligible citizen a chance to vote in person before Election Day. Early voting helps election officials by reducing stress on the system and shortening lines on Election Day, and it helps voters by improving access.

	Implement same-day registration.
If systems are upgraded and laws are modified to permit eligible voters register same day.  Generally, in India, voter’s registration ends weeks before an election and many voters are not able to pay attention for various reasons. That leaves too many citizens outside the democratic process. Hence , voters should be allowed to show up on Election Day to register or to update their registration status and cast a ballot. This turnout-boosting reform would provide much-needed flexibility for today's mobile society.

	Permit some or all voting to mail: 
In growing Digital scenario in India, we must think of letting people pick up or print out ballots and simply mail them into their local voting office. There are some concerns to only allowing mail-in voting, including ballots getting lost in the mail and potentially making it easier for family members or peers to coerce a person into voting a certain way. But mail-in voting is one way that states can potentially expand voting time on the cheap, since they no longer need to hire staff to supervise polling booths.

	Make voting easier for people with disabilities: 
People with disabilities can face huge challenges when they head to the voting booth, from difficulty reading a ballot to a lack of wheelchair-accessible ramps. 
Hence, they must be allowed to cast their vote in advance thru safe and secured systems.

	Make voting compulsory: 
This wouldn’t necessarily make voting easier, but it could drive a lot more people to the polls. 

	Online voting: 
This would be the most convenient form of voting possible for anyone with a computer, tablet, or phone connected to the internet. But there are enormous security risks: At a time when hackers are managing to break into all sorts of places — and even shutting down the internet for huge swaths of the country — it’s extremely risky. Before online voting is ever implemented, these risks will need to be figured out.

	Invest in integrated voter engagement and outreach: 
Integrated voter engagement groups combine issue advocacy and organizing with voter mobilization to effectuate positive change within the assembly area 

Such activities include the testing and certification of the systems and the installation of software on voting or counting machines. Those observing elections need to make additional efforts to monitor these processes, which take place outside of the normal window of election observation.

Since election observers and party/candidate agents may not have the expertise needed to understand certain aspects of electronic voting and counting technologies, organizations and parties may need to hire personnel specifically with an information and communications technology (ICT) background. They may also decide they are unable to assess certain aspects of the process and, if so, should disclose in their reporting which parts of the process they have and have not been able to observe effectively and take this into account in their overall assessment of electoral integrity.
